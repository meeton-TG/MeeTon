# Business Model

* 項目長久注意力（激情褪去後)? Build a great community that create an environment & experiences that retain users, turning them into loyal advocates (擁護者). Instead of just pushing users down a 'traditional' sales funnel.
* What is our branding story?
* A sticky tokenomics and successful game design offers user engagement and retention, not pure monetization.
* MeeTON的定位? 強烈的人格特質和專長?

<summary>GTM Strategy</summary>
