# Chatbot ushers in a post-APP era

## What are the pain points?

The rise of chatbots reflects "user fatigue with the need to download different apps one by one." According to SensorTower, the average downloads of the top 15 app publishers in the US dropped by 20% in May 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, indicating that the app market has passed its peak growth period and signaling the arrival of the "post-app" era.

## How can we help? Chatbot&#x20;

Chatbot allows users to access different interfaces in a chatroom, creating an one-stop service where users enjoy an All-in-One experience through a "chat" approach.
