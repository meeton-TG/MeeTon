## What are the pain points?

According to SensorTower, the average downloads of the top 15 app publishers in the US dropped by 20% in May 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, indicating that the app market has passed its peak growth period and signaling the arrival of the "post-app" era.

缺點:&#x20;

\- 技術困境: 無法做到自然地與用戶對話，實際上是一個嵌套在通訊App內的自動訊息回覆軟體，功能不脫最基本的查詢和客服

\- 後台維運人力不足

\- 資料庫建置不齊全等，也有不少中途停擺，可能因此造成使用者體驗不佳，使用人數、熱度普遍低落
